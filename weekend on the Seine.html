<p>I was lucky enought to spend three days visiting Paris this month!&nbsp; I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p>On our first day, we started by visiting<em> Montmartre</em> right away.&nbsp; Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check oiut that beautiful picture!)&nbsp; We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>. </p>

<h4><strong>Day 2</strong></h4>
<p>On our second day, we went shopping on<em> Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>.&nbsp; Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.</p>
<p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places!&nbsp; We went to<em> Notre Dame.</em> We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all the best macarons the city had to offer.&nbsp; After we finished shopping, we visited<em> le Louvre</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
<p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>.&nbsp; It's huge!&nbsp; We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay.</em> Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking.&nbsp; I was surprised to see that the museum also had manyi sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye. </p>
